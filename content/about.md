Hello, and welcome to my personal website!  My name is Manuel Lecha and I'm from Barcelona, Spain. I am a Mathematician and a Computer Scientist who has recently graduated from the Master of Advanced Mathematics at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. 

It is my professional goal to help build a better world through the advancement of science and technology. I am deeply interested in pure and computational mathematics, especially algebraic topology, geometry, artificial intelligence and algorithmics.

Until now I have specialized myself in computational topology, in particular in general persistent homology theory, which is a booming field. I am currently interested in applying mathematical theory to the development of artificial intelligence, in particular to computer vision.

On this page I will provide an overview of my professional and academic experiences. However, if you are just interested in a one-page summary of it, I personally invite you to take a look at my [CV](https://cvws.icloud-content.com/B/ASyUNn3BJI4Zy_Q0Z1zPP3xagCLxAZOJ04gbP_3sj7ble6R0eAf5_Fr5/ManuelLecha_CV_2022.pdf?o=AqDK-ZXs-7l1LEC-0mo4qj9RZhnZ4SDl-idPd8x7-LXR&v=1&x=3&a=CAogWpFZzW0E-XfFtuBP4-La7h2OBW4yljMWbZEm-QDGnVgSbxC86f7TyzAYvMba1cswIgEAUgRagCLxWgT5_Fr5aifzgjhTMVyUM_qwkT1Bl_6SdHUAHyDmxHAWjIa8R0x_kFT8zr4cIx9yJ5BB4NyMRq5z1gEptSttLABBpoMd-BM6rypYitHsF-tE3QYDufgt-g&e=1669579842&fl=&r=005f59cf-54e0-4d93-9cba-311f88c54d79-1&k=LN3tldMbJ3A2gt-Wi0P3RA&ckc=com.apple.clouddocs&ckz=com.apple.CloudDocs&p=43&s=zWIAIfGu5BQHVzMTdPMqYxZHoQo&cd=i).

## EDUCATION

### Master level

<img src="/UPC.png" alt="UPC" position="center" style="height:50px; width:50px; float: left;"> [Master of Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering](https://mamme.masters.upc.edu/en/) @ Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Sep 2021 - Oct 2022). 

Once I completed my undergraduate degree, there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to continue my studies in mathematics. I wished to broaden my knowledge, explore new areas, and have the option to enroll in a PhD program if I later wanted to.

First, I was planning to study my master's degree abroad. However, due to unexpected family duties I had to stay at my homeplace. 

Once I knew I had to stay in Barcelona, one of the main reasons I chose to enroll in the Master's of Mathematics at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya was because it provided a wide variety of subjects, it allowed me to take both "pure-math" courses, such as Differential Manifolds, Group Theory or Graph Theory, as well as more applied ones, such as Machine Learning or Algorithmic Geometry. Moreover, it allowed students to enroll in subjects from other related masters, even from other universities, like the one I took on Computational Algebra at the Universitat de Barcelona. 

Of course I do not have to mention the quality of the faculty and their members.

- **Courses**: Machine Learning, Algorithmic Geometry,  Differential Manifolds, Computational Algebra,  Graph Theory, Group Theory and Representation Group Theory.
  
- **Thesis**: Multiparameter Persistent Homology.


### Bachelor level

I studied the following two bachelors simultaneously in a dual pathway program offered by the Universitat de Barcelona (UB).

<img src="/UB.png" alt="UB" position="center" style="height:50px; width:50px; float: left;"> [Bachelor of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://mat.ub.edu/degreecomputer/) @ Universitat de Barcelona (Sep 2015 - Feb 2021).

-  **Favourite courses**: Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Algorithmics, Computer Graphics, Software Design, Integrated Software Project and Distributed Software.

-  **Favourite Courses**: Algebra, Geometry and Topology related courses. 

As a result of being enrolled in the Maths-CS joint program, I had to present a single thesis covering capacities from both degrees.

One day, while in a Computer Vision class, I started to think about extracting topological features from data for classification and learning tasks. I instantly googled the words Topology and Data to check if there was any existing material in that regard. I immediately discovered an entire field of research covering it, called Topological Data Analysis. After reading a bit, I realised it was a worthwhile topic to explore during my thesis.

TDA aims to use techniques coming from algebraic topology to define descriptors of datasets. Therefore, drawing on knowledge from Topology, Machine Learning and Computational Theory. It was a perfect match for me, and I am still keeping an eye on developments in the field.

- **Thesis**: Topological Data Analysis for Time Series Analysis.

### Education Abroad

<img src="/WARWICK.png" alt="WARWICK" position="center" style="height:50px; width:50px; float: left;"> [Bachelor of Mathematics (4th year)](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/mathsbsc/) @ University of Warwick (Sep 2018 - Jul 2019).

I consider myself a curious person who has always been eager to discover and experience new things. To some degree, staying in my comfort zone makes me feel uncomfortable.

My only family trip outside Spain was to London when I was twelve. I still remember it with deep affection. After that, I visited a few more cities by myself. Unfortunately, only European cities for now. However, I keep visualizing myself as someone who will not have Barcelona as the only place to call home, but will experience living in other places around the world.

As a result, when I had the opportunity to apply for an Erasmus+ grant and cover my expenses for studying at a university abroad, I didn´t doubt it. It was my first real chance to live in a foreign country.

I still remember checking the entire options list and quickly deciding that the University of Warwick was the most suitable match.

First, it offered the option to stay there for a year. In fact, it was a must. There was only one exam period at the end of the course, and some subjects were taught annually.

Second, it was in England, a country where I had always wanted to live for a while. In addition, it was relatively close to London, and since my childhood trip, I have always looked forward to visiting it again. Furthermore, England was a wise choice, because no additional language than English was required for the application.

Last but not least, the University of Warwick was the most recognised mathematical institution among all possible picks. In the past, I had heard several compliments about their teachings.

Being accepted to Warwick did not just mean studying maths at a top-tier university but most importantly, learning and growing as a human being. I met people not only from England but from a wide range of different cultures, some of whom I still consider friends. 

Definitely one of the most beneficial decisions I have made. By the way, I visited London 5+ times that year. I love that city!


### Other 


<img src="/UPC.png" alt="UPC" position="center" style="height:50px; width:50px; float: left;"> [Postgraduate Diploma in Financial Mathematics](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/364800/posgrado-tecnicas-cuantitativas-mercados-financieros/) @ Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Oct 2020 - Jul 2021).

Researching TDA's state-of-the-art methods for Time Series Analysis for my thesis, I came across several articles discussing applications to financial time series. My curiosity led me to read about Financial Maths theory, which quickly made me realize how little I knew about finance.

At that time I discovered a postgraduate program offered by the UPC, which covered several math-finance topics. This course examined both the elements of financial markets and the methodologies, techniques, and tools for valuing and modelling products, evaluating risks, and taking financial decisions.

As the class hours fit perfectly into my schedule, and I thought I would benefit both personally and professionally from learning more about finance and being more business driven, I decided to enroll.
