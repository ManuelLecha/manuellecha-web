<!--- Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Manuel Lecha and I'm from Barcelona, Spain. I am a Mathematician and a Computer Scientist who has recently graduated from the Master of Advanced Mathematics at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.

It is my professional goal to help build a better world through the advancement of science and technology. I am deeply interested in pure and computational mathematics, especially in geometry, algebraic topology, category theory, artificial intelligence and algorithmics.

Until now I have specialized myself in computational topology, in particular in general persistent homology theory. I am currently delving into the field of geometrical deep learning.-->

Hello, and welcome to my website! I am Manuel Lecha, a Research Scientist at the Mathematics & Computer Science department of the University of Barcelona. I hold an MSc in Mathematics from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and two BScs, one in Mathematics, and another in Computer Science, both from the University of Barcelona (UB).

My main fields of interest are geometry, applied algebraic topology, group theory, category theory, artificial intelligence and algorithmics. During my bachelor's and master's thesis, I got into the field of topological data analysis, in particular, I studied the theory and applications of persistent homology, in both its univariate and multivariate versions. 

Currently, I am delving into the field of geometrical deep learning---invariance and equivariance w.r.t. group actions as a prior for building new deep neural network architectures. I am falling in love with that approach!

On this page I will provide an overview of my professional and academic experiences. However, if you are just interested in a one-page summary of it, I personally invite you to take a look at my [CV](https://cvws.icloud-content.com/B/ASyUNn3BJI4Zy_Q0Z1zPP3xagCLxAZOJ04gbP_3sj7ble6R0eAf5_Fr5/ManuelLecha_CV_2022.pdf?o=AtlnXuQpqplgqq-i0yKv9n4olI66Hw4hnRv_PGH1SZhH&v=1&x=3&a=CAogTfbu0TgpKMQ9JVsGxeDJkMO3y8o2Y18tTVqBlA2WEQoSbxDQj6SY3jAY0Oz_md4wIgEAUgRagCLxWgT5_Fr5aifbQSz6Y4lJ2ysNsDgdoHiw2c16Kiw3zRt50MFZMHhTPrBK23imcnlyJ_VxJmK2eujZ39pCfZMEUBjk1HDMVyl14UdvJd4fBodwEfE3VrL2CA&e=1674554898&fl=&r=1c1c2c92-c64f-4ac0-a5c1-57652dfe51a3-1&k=LN3tldMbJ3A2gt-Wi0P3RA&ckc=com.apple.clouddocs&ckz=com.apple.CloudDocs&p=43&s=iSB4EjSLj42YGhHMLSlx8EcNLWM&cd=i).

## EDUCATION

### Master level

After completing my undergraduate studies, I wanted to broaden my knowledge in pure and applied mathematics, with a view towards the application to Machine Learning. 

First, I was planning to study for my master's degree abroad, which I thought would be tremendously fulfilling and beneficial. However, due to some unexpected family duties, I had to stay in my hometown, Barcelona.

The Master's of Mathematics at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya offers a broad curriculum of subjects from different fields, allowing the students to choose among them all. Therefore, I finally considered it the best option for me.

- **Choosen Electives**: 
  - Machine Learning.
  - Algorithmic Geometry.
  - Differential Manifolds.
  - Graph Theory.
  - Group Theory.
  - Computational Algebra.
  - Representation Group Theory.
  
- **Thesis**: Towards Multiparameter Persistent Homology.

<!--- Once I completed my undergraduate degree, there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to continue my studies in mathematics. I wished to broaden my knowledge, explore new areas, and have the option to enroll in a PhD program if I later wanted to.

First, I was planning to study my master's degree abroad. However, due to unexpected family duties I had to stay at my homeplace. 

Once I knew I had to stay in Barcelona, one of the main reasons I chose to enroll in the Master's of Mathematics at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya was because it provided a wide variety of subjects, it allowed me to take both "pure-math" courses, such as Differential Manifolds, Group Theory or Graph Theory, as well as more applied ones, such as Machine Learning or Algorithmic Geometry. Moreover, it allowed students to enroll in subjects from other related masters, even from other universities, like the one I took on Computational Algebra at the Universitat de Barcelona. 

Of course I do not have to mention the quality of the faculty and their members.-->


### Bachelor level

I studied the following two bachelors simultaneously in a dual pathway program offered by the Universitat de Barcelona (UB).

<img src="/UB.png" alt="UB" position="center" style="height:50px; width:50px; float: left;"> [Bachelor of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://mat.ub.edu/degreecomputer/) @ Universitat de Barcelona (Sep 2015 - Feb 2021).

-  **Preferred courses**: Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Algorithmics, Computer Graphics, Software Design, Integrated Software Project and Distributed Software.

-  **Preferred Courses**: Algebra, Geometry and Topology related courses. 

As a result of being enrolled in the Maths-CS joint program, I had to present a single thesis covering capacities from both degrees.

One day, while in a Computer Vision class, I started to think about extracting topological features from data for classification and learning tasks. I instantly googled the words Topology and Data to check if there was any existing material in that regard. I immediately discovered an entire field of research covering it, called Topological Data Analysis (TDA). 

TDA aims to use techniques coming from algebraic topology and machine learning to estimate topological quantities and define topological descriptors of datasets. Therefore, drawing on knowledge from Topology, Machine Learning and Computational Theory. It was a perfect match for me! 

- **Thesis**: Topological Data Analysis for Time Series Analysis.

### Education Abroad

As a person who is always eager to discover new things and push beyond my comfort zone, I jumped at the opportunity to study abroad at the University of Warwick in England. Not only did Warwick offer a rare opportunity for a full year stay, unlike most other universities that only offered half a year, but it was also located in a country I've always dreamed of living in and had a reputation as a top mathematical institution.

The experience was truly transformative, I was able to immerse myself in a new culture, make lifelong friends from diverse backgrounds, and expand my perspective on the world. It was one of the most beneficial decisions I have ever made. 

Additionally, I took advantage of my time abroad to travel and visited places such as Cambridge and London, I visited London more than 5 times, and it has become one of my favorite cities. 

I highly recommend studying abroad to anyone who wants to challenge themselves and grow as an individual. Don't be afraid to take a leap of faith and explore the world, you never know what it might bring.

<!--- I consider myself a curious person who has always been eager to discover and experience new things. To some degree, staying in my comfort zone makes me feel uncomfortable.

My only family trip outside Spain was to London when I was twelve. I still remember it with deep affection. After that, I visited a few more cities by myself. Unfortunately, only European cities for now. However, I keep visualizing myself as someone who will not have Barcelona as the only place to call home, but will experience living in other places around the world.

As a result, when I had the opportunity to apply for an Erasmus+ grant and cover my expenses for studying at a university abroad, I didn´t doubt it. It was my first real chance to live in a foreign country.

I still remember checking the entire options list and quickly deciding that the University of Warwick was the most suitable match.

First, it offered the option to stay there for a year. In fact, it was a must. There was only one exam period at the end of the course, and some subjects were taught annually.

Second, it was in England, a country where I had always wanted to live for a while. In addition, it was relatively close to London, and since my childhood trip, I have always looked forward to visiting it again. Furthermore, England was a wise choice, because no additional language than English was required for the application.

Last but not least, the University of Warwick was the most recognised mathematical institution among all possible picks. In the past, I had heard several compliments about their teachings.

Being accepted to Warwick did not just mean studying maths at a top-tier university but most importantly, learning and growing as a human being. I met people not only from England but from a wide range of different cultures, some of whom I still consider friends. 

Definitely one of the most beneficial decisions I have made. By the way, I visited London 5+ times that year. I love that city!-->

### Other 

<!--While researching TDA's state-of-the-art methods for Time Series Analysis, I came across several articles discussing applications to financial time series. My curiosity led me to read about Financial Maths theory, which quickly made me realize how little I knew about finance. This sparked my interest in learning more about finance, and I discovered a postgraduate program offered by the UPC that covered several math-finance topics. I saw this as an opportunity to learn about financial markets, methodologies, techniques and tools for valuing and modelling products, their risks and learn to make financial decisions. As the class schedule fit perfectly with mine and I believed it would benefit me both personally and professionally, I decided to enroll in the program.-->
